/**
 * dsh-rewind portal half: the per-user-message ↶ rewind button, rendered as a
 * React portal inside the message's `MessageIconActions` row.
 *
 * Why portals (aligned with the copy button's own rendering): the copy button
 * is a React child of the actions row, painted in the same commit as the
 * bubble. A pure-DOM `appendChild` (the earlier approach) lands one microtask
 * later and re-runs a full-transcript scan on EVERY mutation, which can push
 * the paint of a newly sent bubble — the "occasional hiccup before the bubble
 * shows". Portals let React own the button lifecycle (mount/unmount with the
 * row, no orphaned buttons, no manual re-attach after harness re-renders),
 * and the target collection is coalesced (one refresh per mutation batch) and
 * diffed (no setState churn when nothing changed).
 *
 * Mount point: the plugin registers a session-scoped bridge into the harness's
 * `conversation.session.header.actions` list slot. The bridge renders NO
 * header UI — it only portals buttons into the user rows of the session the
 * harness mounts it for. That slot is the harness-native way to get a
 * per-session React mount without touching any source; the registration is
 * typed structurally (see `SlotsLike`) so the plugin never imports the
 * conversation UI package's types and survives its version drift.
 *
 * COUPLING NOTE — HIGH. There is no harness interface for a per-user-message
 * action (see docs/compat/audit.md): `MessageIconActions.extraActions` and the
 * `conversation.chat.assistant-actions` slot are wired for assistant messages
 * only, and no per-user-message action slot exists. So this portal targets
 * undocumented internal structure — the `data-chat-flow-kind`,
 * `data-chat-anchor-key`, `data-composer-input`, `data-composer-card` and
 * `data-pending-steering` attributes plus the `anchorSeq` field read in
 * `client/hidden.ts`. Those are harness-internal and may change with the UI;
 * this module (and `hidden.ts`) must be re-adapted to follow, and is the
 * migration target when a first-class user-action slot or an official renderer
 * hook surface appears. The coupling is accepted deliberately because a
 * standards-conformant alternative does not exist today; it is not a defect to
 * be removed while the DOM-portal approach stands.
 *
 * Re-verified against 0.1.6-alpha.2: the five remaining anchors still exist (the
 * anchor key and flow kind still come from `ChatNodeSeat`, values `user` /
 * `steering`); only `data-time-hover-root` is gone, and nothing read it.
 *
