/**
 * dsh-rewind host half: the `/rewind` command and the Claude-Code-style
 * checkpoint store, composed as one dual-face bundle row (the browser half
 * lives in `src/client/`).
 *
 * Rewind mechanism: planning is pure (`src/rewind.ts`); execution appends a
 * marker `user/message` whose `surfaceOp` replaces every surface node after the
 * target with itself, cutting only the model-visible surface
 * (`docs/architecture.md`).
 *
 * File restore (mode `both`) follows Claude Code's checkpointing: unless
 * `fileCheckpointingEnabled` is off, the plugin backs up each tracked
 * write-class edit BEFORE it happens (at the
 * `tools/execute` around-dispatch stage, so an approval short-circuit cannot
 * skip the capture and a denied call never records), commits the backup under
 * the turn's anchor message seq at `tools/post-execute`, and a rewind to
 * message N restores every backup anchored at or after N — modified files are
 * written back to their pre-edit content, files created after N are deleted.
 * Backups persist on disk under the dsh data directory (newest 100 message
 * groups per session), so restores work after a host restart, and they
 * read/write the real file system with plain `node:fs` — independent of the
 * fs service. See `src/snapshot.ts`.
